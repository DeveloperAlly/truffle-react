# truffle-react

This is a modified version of the truffle box project - https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes/react

truffle-react box doesn't appear to work "out of the box". I added next (server side front end rendering) to enable a working client for this module. 

Contracts were not changed.


To run (from root directory
>npm install

>truffle compile

>truffle migrate

>npm run dev


The contract config needs fixing though I think.

Check out my truffle-campaign github for a working deployed to rinkeby project with react
